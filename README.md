# micro:bit Project Collection

There are two sets of programs written in Python for the [BBC micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) using micro:bit's micropython library. These programs will all work using micro:bit [online editor / programmer](https://python.microbit.org/v/3) The programs are divided into two sets that were used for different summer camp groups.

[GenCyber](https://public.cyber.mil/gencyber/) was an NSA sponsored week long camp for middle and high school students to learn cyber security concepts including programming.

[EPIC](https://epic.calpoly.edu/) (Engineering Possibilities in College) is a week long camp sponsored by Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo for middle and high school students to introduce and foster interest in engineering topics and skills.
